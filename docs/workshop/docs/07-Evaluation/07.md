# 6.7 Create Graph Database

Hosting graph databases in Azure Database for PostgreSQL using the Apache AGE extension offers a powerful way to analyze relationships within your data. AGE combines graph and relational data seamlessly, leveraging the openCypher query language for efficient graph processing. This integration brings PostgreSQL's scalability, performance, and security to the table while enabling advanced data analysis and management. When incorporated into a copilot, this setup empowers you to evaluate vendor performance of SOW deliverables through invoice validation, ensuring your data-driven decisions are robust and insightful.

Once you have created your graph database, it will be incorporated into the _Woodgrove Bank API_ as an extra tool available to the copilot, allowing you to improve RAG accuracy when retrieving relevant data. By using another function call, the copilot will be able to execute cypher queries against the graph database hosted in Azure Database for PostgreSQL using AGE while maintaining the existing capabilities of querying data in Postgres.

## Woodgrove Graph

Graph databases allow you to model complex relationships between data using nodes and edges, making it easier to represent and query these relationships. You will build a simple graph using the data you extracted from the Woodgrove Bank database. You will define `vendors` and `sows` as nodes in your graph and use `invoices` as the edge between them. Edges in graph databases define a one-to-one relationship between two entities, defined as nodes. The diagram below provides a high-level representation of the graph database.

![Diagram of the simple graph database for vendors, invoices, and SOWs.](../img/vendors-invoices-sows-graph.png)

Edges must include a mapping of related entities through ID mapping and can also include properties, which allow the relationship to be filtered at query time.

## Create Graph Database with AGEFreighter

[AGEFreighter](https://github.com/rioriost/agefreighter/) is a Python library designed to simplify the process of creating and loading graph databases in Azure Database for PostgreSQL, allowing data to be ingested from various sources, including CSV file, Azure Cosmos DB, Neo4j, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Review code

The solution accelerator includes the `graph_loader.py` file in the `src/api/app` folder, which allows you to quickly run a Python script to create a graph database and populate it with data from CSV files.

The graph loader is implemented in the `src/api/app/graph_loader.py` file. Open it now in Visual Studio Code and explore the code in sections. You can also expand the section below to see the code inline and review explanations for the code.

        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

1. **Import libraries** (lines 1-5): Required classes and functions are imported from various libraries.

2. **Define `main` function** (line 7): The `main` function is the entry point of the graph loader. This function serves as the orchestrator for executing the code within the file.

3. **Load environment variables** (lines 10-17): The `load_dotenv()` method from the `dotenv` Python library allows variables from the `.env` file within the API project to be loaded as environment variables in the project. Note the names of the variables here, as you will be adding those to your `.env` file in the next step.

4. **Create an AGEFreighter factory** (line 21): The entry point for the `agefreighter` package in the `factory` class. This method creates an instance of the library using the type specified. You are loading your graph using multiple CSV files, so the `MultiCSVFreighter` class type is indicated.

5. **Connect to PostgreSQL** (lines 25-28): The `connect` method of the `factory` opens a connection to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

      1. The `get_connection_string()` function uses values from your environment variables to define the connection string the `factory` will use to connect to your database.
      2. The `get_connection_string()` function is defined on lines 55-66.

6. **Download CSV files from blob storage** (line 34): The CSV files you created in the previous task are downloaded from blob storage and written into a local folder, where the graph loader can easily access them.

      1. The `download_csvs()` function is defined on lines 68-81. This function creates a `BlobServiceClient` instance, which is used to retrieve the blobs in your storage account's `graph` container.
      2. For each blob with the extension of `.csv`, the `download_csv` function defined on lines 83-99 is used to retrieve the blob's contents and write them into a local file.

7. **Create and load the graph database** (lines 38-51): The `load` method of the `factory` does the following:

      1. Creates a graph named `vendor_graph`.
      2. Defines vertex (node) data and labels and inserts the nodes into the graph.
      3. Specifies edges using labels and inserts them to establish the relationships between the nodes.

8. **Define the main guard** (lines 101-108): The main guard defines how the `graph_loader` is executed when called directly. This code block lets you run the script from a command line or VS Code debugging session.

## Update `.env` file

The `graph_loader.py` file references environment variables to retrieve information about your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance, your Entra ID username, and the storage account from which to pull CSV files. Before executing the graph loader script, you must update your project's `.env` file with these values. The `.env` file can be found in the `src\api\app` folder of the repo.

1. In VS Code, navigate to the `src\api\app` folder in the **Explorer** panel.

2. Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

    !!! danger "Update your `.env` file!"

    ```ini title=""
    ENTRA_ID_USERNAME="{YOUR_ENTRA_ID_USERNAME}"
    POSTGRESQL_SERVER_NAME="{YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER_NAME}"
    STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="{YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}"
    ```

    ???+ tip "Follow these steps to retrieve the necessary values"

        1. Replace the `{YOUR_ENTRA_ID_USERNAME}` token in the `ENTRA_ID_USERNAME` variable's value with your Microsoft Entra ID, which should be the email address of the account you are using for this solution accelerator.

        2. Replace the `{YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER_NAME}` token with the name of your PostgreSQL server. To get your server name:

           1. Navigate to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

           2. In the **Essentials** panel of the PostgreSQL flexible server's **Overview** page, copy the **Server name** value and paste it into your `.env` file as the `POSTGRESQL_SERVER_NAME` value.

            ![Screenshot of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL page in the Azure portal with the server name highlighted in the Overview Essentials panel.](../img/azure-postgresql-server-name.png)

        3. Replace the `{YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}` token with the name of your storage account. To retrieve your storage account name:

           1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Storage account resource in your resource group.

           2. On the Storage account page, copy the storage account name and paste it into your `.env` file as the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` value.

            ![Screenshot of the App Configuration Access Settings page, with the Endpoint copy button highlighted.](../img/azure-storage-account-name.png)

3. Save the `.env` file.

## Load the graph database

You will use a VS Code debugging session to locally execute the `graph_loader.py` script. Follow the steps below to start a _Graph Loader_ debug session in VS Code.

1. In Visual Studio Code **Run and Debug** panel, select the **Graph Loader** option from the debug configurations dropdown list.

    ![Screenshot of the Run and Debug panel, with the Run and Debug configurations dropdown list expanded and the Graph Loader option highlighted.](../img/vs-code-run-and-debug-selection-graph-loader.png)

2. Select the **Start Debugging** button (or press F5 on your keyboard).

    ![Screenshot of the Start Debugging button highlighted next to the Run and Debug configurations dropdown list.](../img/vs-code-start-debugging-graph-loader.png)

3. Wait for the graph loader to finish running, indicated by the `Graph data loaded successfully!` message in the terminal output.

    ![Screenshot of the output panel, with Graph data loaded successfully highlighted.](../img/vs-code-graph-loader-complete.png)

## Verify data load

You will execute openCypher queries using **pgAdmin** to verify the data load and explore relationships in your graph database.

1. Return to **pgAdmin** and ensure it is connected to your PostgreSQL database.

2. In the pgAdmin **Object Explorer**, expand databases under your PostgreSQL server.

3. Right-click the **contracts** database and select **Query Tool** from the context menu.

4. Before you can run cypher queries, you must set the `ag_catalog` schema in your path:

    !!! danger "Execute the following SQL commands in pgAdmin!"

    ```sql
    SET search_path = ag_catalog, "$user", public;
    ```

5. Now, run the following cypher query to view vendors with open invoices, the details of those invoices, and verify your graph database was loaded correctly:

    !!! danger "Execute the following SQL commands in pgAdmin!"

    ```sql
    -- View vendors and SOWs, along with invoice details from edge properties
    SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('vendor_graph', $$
    MATCH (v:vendor)-[rel:has_invoices]->(s:sow)
    RETURN v.id AS vendor_id, v.name AS vendor_name, s.id AS sow_id, s.number AS sow_number, rel.payment_status AS payment_status, rel.amount AS invoice_amount
    $$) as graph_query(vendor_id BIGINT, vendor_name TEXT, sow_id BIGINT, sow_number TEXT, payment_status TEXT, invoice_amount FLOAT);
    ```

!!! success "Congratulations! You have successfully loaded your graph database with data from PostgreSQL."
