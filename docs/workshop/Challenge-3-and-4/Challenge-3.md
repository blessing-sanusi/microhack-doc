# Workshop Challenge: Changing the Logo in the App

One of the easiest and most fun changes you can make to the app is updating the logo! Follow these step-by-step instructions to replace the current logo with your own.

---

## **Step 1: Prepare Your New Logo**
1. Create or use a new logo (e.g contosoImg logo) in `src/app/src/Assets/`.
2. Save the logo as an image file (e.g., `logo.png`).
3. Ensure the image has a reasonable size (e.g., 100x100 pixels) for better display.
4. Place the logo file in the following folder:
    `src/app/src/Assets/`

---


## Step 2: Update the Logo Component

1. Open the `App.tsx` file located at:  
   `src/App/src/App.tsx`


2. Comment out the original import on **line 24**:

   ```tsx
   // import { AppLogo } from "./components/Svg/Svg";
   ```

3. Add a new import statement for your logo image:

   ```tsx
   import AppLogo from "./Assets/contosoimg/ContosoImg.png";
   ```

4. Locate the current logo implementation (around line 309):
    
    ```tsx
   <AppLogo />
   ```


5. Comment out the existing logo component and replace it with the image tag:

   ```tsx
   // <AppLogo />
   <img src={AppLogo} alt="Logo" style={{ width: '30px' }} />
   ```



## Step 3: Run the App

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory where start.cmd is located:
   `cd src/`

3. Run the following command: 
   `./start.cmd`

4. Two terminal windows will open â€” one for the backend and one for the frontend.
Once the app starts, you should see your new logo in action!
